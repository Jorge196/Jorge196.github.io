<p>As a person that had no experience of coding before joining the Flatiron School, I think this was a very humbling experience. I don't think I can remember the last time where I had to really think long and hard on how to fix and complete a problem. I really had to take a step back and reevaluate how I had to approach a problem with my coding. I enjoyed doing this for the mental stimulation that I got out of it. It showed I still need a lot to improve in my knowledge in coding and just have to keep on trying and reviewing what I've learned thus far. </p>
