This project was a strenious project for me, but I am glad I got to experience doing this. It gave more clarity of what it takes to make a website and how much work it is to make it work correctly. There were times where I had to constantly switch from controller to views files in order for my Get and Post route to  work correctly. Overall it was a struggle for me to get it to work correctly, but it was a struggle I needed to take in order for me to learn and get better at this.
