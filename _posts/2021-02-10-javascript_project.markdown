Once I started getting the hang of understanding the basics of JavaScript coding for my project was slightly less challenging. JavaScript is a single-threaded and synchronus language, meaning that one thing at a time can be excuted and the next task can only be executed until the first one is executed. Understanding fetch and promises for this project, has been a major hurdle for me being new to JavaScript.

A Fetch method is a method that makes an HTTP request to a server asynchronusly. The fetch request returns the object of a Promise, a promise is essentially an object that represents the completion of an asynchronus operation. A Promise object has a “state” that gives us information about the status of our request; 
pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. 
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
 
 Understanding this now made it easier for me to explain exactly what goes on in my code when I try to talk out the relationship to the backend code of the api to my frontend code.
