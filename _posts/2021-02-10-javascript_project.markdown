This project showed me that the key to coding is patience. If I don't have any patience, then I won't be able to really succeed when it comes to coding. There was a lot of hardship, and alot of disappointments even to the very end, but I am glad I was able to overcome it and finish it. I really had to understand what I had to do when it came to creating static functions for a particular class function, and why EventListeners were not really listening lol. Overall I learned a valuable lesson when it came to this project. "In order to go fast you must first go slow" as my cohort lead has always told me.
