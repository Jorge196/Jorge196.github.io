I decided to study Software Engineering, because I wanted to explore something new and try out something I have never done before. I always had an interest in computers and new technology but I did not persue it my first time around in school because I was always doubting myself and felt that I was not going to be good enough to do this. So, I decided to just try this with a different mindset, instead of thinking "I am going to fail", I want to able to look at this as an opportunity to improve myself.  I also want to be able to see where this will take me, and hopefully I can successfully make a career out of this.
