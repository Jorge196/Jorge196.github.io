I have to say I thought that things were going to get a tiny bit simpler for my third module project, but it was not. There were so many things that just kept going wrong for me, but I am glad I got to over come it. The experience I had during this project taught me a lot and really tested my patience to the extreme. I have hope that my coding experience will get easier as I make my way to the next module, but I think that might be asking for too much :).
